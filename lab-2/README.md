## 1. Introduction
In computer science, to communicate with the computer hardware, the user needs some languages for programming purposes, such as C#, Python, and Java. **For constructing the languages, there are some rules to be followed. The rules are called the
grammar for that programming language.**

## 2. Grammar
A grammar is a _**set of rules**_ to defne a **valid** sentence in any language.  
A grammar (G) consists of four tuples:  
**G = {V<sub>N</sub>, ∑, P, S}** , where
* **V<sub>N</sub>**: Set of Non-terminals.
* **∑**: Set fo terminals.
*  **P**: Production rule.
* **S**: Start Symbol.  

**Non-terminal (V<sub>N</sub>)** symbols are those symbols which can be replaced multiple times (UPPERCASE letters).  
**Terminal symbols (∑)** are those symbols which cannot be replaced further (lowercase letters).  
In most of the cases, a grammar is represented by **only the production rules**.   

### Example 1  
Find the language generated by the following grammar:   
**S → aSa/aba**  

###### Solution 
According to the production rules, we can replace `S` (start symbol) with one of two options:
1. **aSa**: which contains one _non-terminal Symbol_ `S`, meaning that _the production is not done yet_ because `S` can be replaced again.
2. **aba**: which is all _terminal symbols_ meaning that the production is complete.  

Considering these two options, we have a fixed **`a`** at the beginning of the word **a**Sa or **a**ba.  

The next symbol can be `S` again. S → aSa → aaSaa → aaaSaaa ... and this may continue until `aba` (terminal) is reached ... → aaa(aSa)aaa → **a<sup>n</sup>ba<sup>n</sup>**.  

Hence, for `n` replacements of `S`, we get **a<sup>n</sup>ba<sup>n</sup>**:  

L(G) = **a<sup>n</sup>ba<sup>n</sup>**, n > 0.

### Example 2
Find the language generated by the following grammar:  
**S → aSb/aAB, A → bAa/ba**

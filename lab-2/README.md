## 1. Introduction
In computer science, to communicate with the computer hardware, the user needs some languages for programming purposes, such as C#, Python, and Java. **For constructing the languages, there are some rules to be followed. The rules are called the
grammar for that programming language.**

## 2. Grammar
A grammar is a _**set of rules**_ to defne a **valid** sentence in any language.  
A grammar (G) consists of four tuples:  
**G = {V<sub>N</sub>, ∑, P, S}** , where
* **V<sub>N</sub>**: Set of Non-terminals.
* **∑**: Set fo terminals.
*  **P**: Production rule.
* **S**: Start Symbol.  

_**Non-terminal (V<sub>N</sub>)**_ symbols are those symbols which can be replaced multiple times.  
_**Terminal symbols (∑)**_ are those symbols which cannot be replaced further.  
In most of the cases, a grammar is represented by **only the production rules**.   

### Example 1  
Find the language generated by the following grammar   
**S → aSa/aba**  

###### Solution 


### Example 2
Find the language generated by the following grammar  
**S → aSb/aAB, A → bAa/ba**
